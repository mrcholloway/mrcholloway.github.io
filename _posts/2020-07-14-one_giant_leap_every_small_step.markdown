"I was terrified."

I lay awake the night of 7/5/20. The night before my maiden voyage into the PT Software Engineering program at Flatiron School.
My thoughts awash with doubt, anxiety and second thoughts. My only true foundation being my dis-satisfaction with my current position and my drive to "do more" and "do better".
Never-the-less I continued to wrestle my decision. "Is this right for me?" "Do I have the background for this?" "Is this another dead-end career move?" "Do I have the time to complete this program?" "Will I Fail?”

Needless to say, not a lot of sleep that night. It only made matters worse that I would be missing the first four (4) full days of class due to my 12hr workday. A recent switch to the healthcare industry had provided the change in job that I needed at the time but I had also inherited a dead-end/time-sink position that facilitated only the most basic satisfaction of "job-well-done" without actually fulfilling my passions, enjoying my duties or my compensation.

I had switched to healthcare after years of bizdev in advertising, sales training & consulting and lastly enterprise technology. My former career had made me comfortable in my finances but I struggled with the disconnect I felt from the development and creation of the solutions I sold to my clients. 
Being a naturally creative person I found myself lingering in the creative or R&D department much longer then a my colleagues in sales.
The "thrill of the hunt" I once harbored was fading and quickly being supplanted by the light bulb of innovation and ingenuity.

My story, while not unique, is the tale of "the little engine that could"...but would it?...would I?...could I?...dare I?
Those same questions I asked myself in January when I finally worked up the courage to contact Flatiron; were now, six (6) months later, still keeping me fully awake on the eve of the first day of the rest of my career.

Needless to say, those first three days of the “First Mile” were awash with "head trash". I doubted everything but doubt itself and I learned that despite negativity externally, it is what you decide internally that matters. 
So that night, despite my fears, I decided I would proceed and even more so; I decided I would “SUCCEED”. 

One day at a time, one lesson at a time; no matter what. I would emerge on the other side of my doubt. I would stand on the horizon of my achievement. If only just to wave goodbye to that part of me that was so scared, so reluctant, so paralyzed to cross that first hurdle, to greet that first day, to walk that first mile.

At the end of all things, when we survey the entirety of the path we walked. I can say I strolled the unknown. I put one foot in front of the other. I faced my greatest fears.

I will not have to say I was scared of that first "step".
